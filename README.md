# Food_Safety

In this project, I analyzed restaurant food safety scores for restaurants in San Francisco using various data science techniques. The goal was to gain insights into the food safety standards of restaurants and identify areas for improvement. I performed the analysis on a dataset provided by the San Francisco Department of Public Health, which contained a collection of restaurant food safety scores.

## Project Description
In this project, I employed a range of data science techniques to explore and analyze the restaurant food safety scores dataset. The following techniques were utilized:

**Reading Simple CSV Files and Using Pandas:** I started by reading the dataset, which was provided in a CSV format, using the Pandas library. Pandas provided efficient tools for data manipulation and analysis, allowing me to easily load, clean, and preprocess the data.

**Working with Data at Different Levels of Granularity:** I examined the restaurant food safety scores at various levels of granularity. This included aggregating the scores at the restaurant level to gain insights into overall safety trends. I also analyzed the scores at different time intervals to identify temporal patterns and understand the changes in food safety practices over time.

**Identifying Data Types, Missing Values, Anomalies:** I performed a comprehensive data exploration to understand the characteristics of the dataset. This included identifying the types of data collected, checking for missing values, and detecting any anomalies or inconsistencies. By employing data profiling techniques and statistical analysis, I ensured the quality and integrity of the data.

**Explored Characteristics and Distributions of Individual Variables:** I delved into the characteristics and distributions of individual variables in the restaurant food safety scores dataset. This involved analyzing statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation to understand the central tendencies and variabilities. I also visualized the distributions using histograms, box plots, or other suitable visualizations to gain insights into the data's underlying patterns.

By leveraging these data science techniques, I aimed to uncover valuable insights regarding restaurant food safety scores in San Francisco. The findings from this analysis can be used to identify areas of improvement, guide policy-making decisions, and contribute to the overall enhancement of food safety standards.
